# üëã Hi, I'm Rimlan


I am a **Master of Business Analytics [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu)**, passionate about using data to uncover insights that drive smarter and more informed decisions.  
My studies have built a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data communication, but what excites me most is **the power of storytelling through analytics and visualisation**.  

I completed my **Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)** with a specialisation in **Data Analytics, Human Resources, and SAP** from **[St Aloysius College (Autonomous), Mangalore](https://staloysius.edu.in/)**.  
During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in business strategy, data interpretation, and enterprise systems, which shaped my analytical mindset and curiosity for uncovering insights through data.

I‚Äôm fascinated by how data connects to almost everything ‚Äî from **business and technology** to **sports and even cooking**. Whether the dataset is small or complex, data always provides a unique lens to understand the world, reveal patterns, and challenge assumptions. I‚Äôm passionate about **transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights** using analytics and visualisation. My studies at Monash have enhanced my technical skills in **statistics, programming, and data communication**, helping me understand the full journey ‚Äî from data wrangling to storytelling and presentation.

This website is my space to share projects, reflect on what I‚Äôm learning, and explore how analytics can turn everyday questions into meaningful insights. I see data not just as numbers, but as a way to connect ideas across disciplines and make sense of complexity.  

Outside the world of data, I enjoy **throwball**, **the gym**, **cooking**, **dancing** and **travelling** ‚Äî hobbies that keep me balanced, curious, and creative in how I approach problem-solving.
