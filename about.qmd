# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rimlan


I am a **Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University**, passionate about using data to uncover insights that drive smarter and more informed decisions.  
My studies have built a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data communication, but what excites me most is **the power of storytelling through analytics and visualisation**.  

Iâ€™m fascinated by how data appears in every part of life â€” from **business and technology** to **sports and even cooking**. Whether the dataset is small or enormous, data always offers a different lens to understand the world, uncover patterns, and challenge assumptions.  

This website is my space to share projects, reflect on what Iâ€™m learning, and explore how analytics can turn everyday questions into meaningful insights. I see data not just as numbers, but as a way to connect ideas across disciplines and make sense of complexity.

## ðŸ§° What I Work With

- **Analysis:** data visualisation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and reproducible pipelines  
- **Communication:** concise analytical writing, clear figure design, and stakeholder-focused reporting  

## ðŸŽ¯ What Iâ€™m Exploring Next

- Developing **high-quality, publication-ready reports** using R and Quarto with strong documentation and cross-referencing  
- Enhancing my ability to **translate analytical findings into strategic business insights**  
- Building **collaborative and reproducible workflows** that promote transparency and team efficiency  

## ðŸ“Œ This Site
