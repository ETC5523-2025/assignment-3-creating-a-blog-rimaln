# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rimlan


I am a **Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University**, passionate about using data to uncover insights that drive smarter and more informed decisions.  
My studies have built a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data communication, but what excites me most is **the power of storytelling through analytics and visualisation**.  

Iâ€™m fascinated by how data appears in every part of life â€” from **business and technology** to **sports and even cooking**. Whether the dataset is small or enormous, data always offers a different lens to understand the world, uncover patterns, and challenge assumptions.  

This website is my space to share projects, reflect on what Iâ€™m learning, and explore how analytics can turn everyday questions into meaningful insights. I see data not just as numbers, but as a way to connect ideas across disciplines and make sense of complexity.
