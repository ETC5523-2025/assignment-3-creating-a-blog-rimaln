    "text": "I am a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, passionate about using data to uncover insights that drive smarter and more informed decisions.\nMy studies have built a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data communication, but what excites me most is the power of storytelling through analytics and visualisation.\nI’m fascinated by how data appears in every part of life — from business and technology to sports and even cooking. Whether the dataset is small or enormous, data always offers a different lens to understand the world, uncover patterns, and challenge assumptions.\nThis website is my space to share projects, reflect on what I’m learning, and explore how analytics can turn everyday questions into meaningful insights. I see data not just as numbers, but as a way to connect ideas across disciplines and make sense of complexity.\n\n\n\n\nData & Code: R (tidyverse, ggplot2, Quarto), Python (pandas), Git/GitHub\n\nAnalysis: data visualisation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model evaluation, and reproducible pipelines\n\nCommunication: concise analytical writing, clear figure design, and stakeholder-focused reporting\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping high-quality, publication-ready reports using R and Quarto with strong documentation and cross-referencing\n\nEnhancing my ability to translate analytical findings into strategic business insights\n\nBuilding collaborative and reproducible workflows that promote transparency and team efficiency\n\n\n\n\nThis site showcases selected coursework and mini-projects from my analytics journey at Monash University.
